# **Wildfire-Image-Classification**

**Objectives**
- To determine the performance efficacy of MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50V2 in wildfire image classification.
  
- To compare the results with a baseline model (CNN) to determine the advantages of pretrained models.
  
- To assess how data augmentation influences the generalisation capability of models
